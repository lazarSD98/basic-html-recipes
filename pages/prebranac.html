    <p>Prebranac is a classic Serbian baked bean dish, known for its rich flavor and simplicity. Made with tender white beans and plenty of caramelized onions,
         it's seasoned with sweet paprika and slowly baked to perfection. Prebranac is especially popular during winter and Orthodox fasting periods, 
         but it's enjoyed year-round as a hearty main or comforting side. It's fully plant-based, affordable, 
         and gets even tastier the next day—making it a true staple of Serbian home cooking.</p>
