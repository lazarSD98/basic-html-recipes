    <h1><i>Sarma</i></h1>
    <p>Sarma is one of the most cherished traditional Serbian dishes, often served at celebrations and family dinners.
        These cabbage rolls are filled with a savory mix of minced meat and rice, wrapped in tangy pickled cabbage
        leaves, then slow-cooked
        in a rich tomato sauce with optional smoked meat for extra depth. The result is a hearty, comforting meal with
        layers of
        flavor that get even better the next day. A true symbol of Balkan home cooking! </p>
